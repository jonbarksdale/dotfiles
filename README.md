# My Dotfiles

Personal dotfiles managed with [chezmoi](https://chezmoi.io). Supports both personal and work-specific configurations through multiple source directories.

## Features

- 🏠 **Multi-source support**: Separate personal and work configurations
- 📦 **Automated package management**: Homebrew, Rust, npm, and more
- 🔧 **Version manager installation**: SDKMAN!, Volta, rustup
- 🎨 **Modern Unix tools**: bat, eza, ripgrep, fd, and many more
- ⌨️ **Editor configs**: Neovim, Vim, Doom Emacs, IntelliJ
- 🐚 **Shell configuration**: Zsh with starship prompt and modern completions
- 🤖 **Claude Code integration**: Pre-configured agents, commands, and contexts

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

On a fresh macOS machine:

```bash
# Install Homebrew
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"

# Install chezmoi
brew install chezmoi
```

### Personal Machine

```bash
# Initialize and apply dotfiles
chezmoi init --apply https://github.com/jonbarksdale/dotfiles.git
```

Alternatively, use chezmoi's one-liner (installs chezmoi temporarily):
```bash
sh -c "$(curl -fsLS get.chezmoi.io)" -- init --apply jonbarksdale/dotfiles
```

### Work Machine

```bash
# Install personal dotfiles first
chezmoi init --apply https://github.com/jonbarksdale/dotfiles.git

# Clone work-specific configurations to a separate location
# (Replace with your work dotfiles repository)
git clone <work-dotfiles-repo> ~/.local/share/dotfiles-work

# Run work dotfiles setup script
cd ~/.local/share/dotfiles-work
./setup.sh
```

**Note**: Your personal `.zshrc` and `.gitconfig` are already configured to source work-specific override files (`~/.zshrc_local`, `~/.gitconfig-local`) if they exist, so the work configuration integrates seamlessly.

## Daily Workflow

### Editing Configuration

Edit files naturally in their normal locations:

```bash
# Edit your zsh config
vim ~/.zshrc

# Edit neovim config
vim ~/.config/nvim/init.lua
```

### Syncing Changes

After editing, capture and sync your changes:

```bash
# See what changed
chezmoi status

# Review changes before committing
chezmoi diff

# Capture changes
chezmoi add ~/.zshrc ~/.config/nvim

# Commit and push (from the source directory)
chezmoi cd
git add -A
git commit -m "Update shell configuration"
git push
```

### Updating Other Machines

On your other machines:

```bash
# Pull latest changes and apply
chezmoi update
```

## Work-Specific Configuration

The personal dotfiles support composition with work-specific configurations via hook files:
- `~/.zshrc_before` - Sourced at the start of shell initialization
- `~/.zshrc_local` - Sourced at the end of shell initialization
- `~/.gitconfig-local` - Included by git config (last wins)
- `~/.profile` - Shell-agnostic environment setup

These files are optional and sourced only if they exist. If you need work-specific overrides, maintain them in a separate work dotfiles repository and use its setup script to create symlinks.

## Troubleshooting

### View what chezmoi would do

```bash
chezmoi apply --dry-run --verbose
```

### Force re-run installation scripts

```bash
# Remove chezmoi state to re-run scripts
rm -rf ~/.local/share/chezmoi/.chezmoistate

# Re-apply
chezmoi apply
```

### Check chezmoi configuration

```bash
chezmoi doctor
```

### Work configs not loading

```bash
# Check if work override files exist and are symlinked
ls -la ~/.zshrc_local ~/.gitconfig-local

# Verify work repo is present
ls -la ~/.local/share/dotfiles-work
```

## Migration from dotbot

This repo was previously managed with dotbot. The migration to chezmoi preserves all functionality while providing:
- Better multi-machine support
- Template support for per-machine customization
- Built-in git integration
- Simpler installation scripts
- Better documentation

See `docs/CHEZMOI_MIGRATION.md` for details on the migration process.

# Documentation Review Standards

Apply when reviewing documentation, ADRs, or technical writing.

## Quick Reference

**Structure Checks**:
- Does it follow the five-question review framework?
- Is the purpose statement clear?
- Is the executive summary written last (after full content)?

**Clarity Checks**:
- Acronyms defined at first usage
- No weasel words or vague qualifiers
- Conclusions not buried

**Reader Value**:
- Optimized for reader's time, not writer's convenience
- No mental math required (calculations included)
- No jumping around required (duplicate content if helpful)

See [reference.md](./reference.md) for detailed standards.

## Quality Assessment Process

### 1. Script-Based Verification (Primary Approach)

**Step 1: Check for Existing Verification Scripts**
```bash
# Look for project verification scripts
find . -name "verify.sh" -o -name "verify-*.sh" -o -path "*/scripts/verify*"
# Check package.json for verify scripts
grep -l "verify" package.json 2>/dev/null
```

**Step 2: Execute Verification Scripts**
```bash
# Python projects with verification script
./scripts/verify.sh
# or if using npm script convention
npm run verify

# Node.js projects with verification script
./scripts/verify.sh
# or npm-based verification
npm run verify
```

**Step 3: Partner with Dev Agents for Script Creation (if missing)**
When verification scripts don't exist, collaborate with development agents:
- Request python-dev agent to create Python verification scripts
- Request nodejs-dev agent to create Node.js verification scripts
- Provide script requirements and quality gate specifications

### 2. Project Analysis
```bash
# Detect project languages and structure
find . -name "*.py" -o -name "pyproject.toml" -o -name "package.json" -o -name "*.ts" -o -name "*.tsx" -o -name "pom.xml"
# Analyze project structure and configuration
# Identify applicable quality standards
```

### 3. Fallback: Individual Command Execution
When verification scripts are unavailable and cannot be quickly created:

```bash
# Python quality pipeline fallback
uv run ruff format .
uv run ruff check .
uv run mypy .
uv run pytest --cov=src --cov-report=term-missing

# Node.js/TypeScript quality pipeline fallback
npm run format
npm run lint
npm run typecheck
npm run test:coverage
npm audit
```

### 4. Verification Evidence Collection
**Evidence Sources:**
- **Script Output**: Verification scripts generate structured reports and artifacts
- **Quality Metrics**: Coverage percentages, linting results, type checking status
- **Test Results**: Test execution summaries, performance metrics
- **Runtime Verification**: Execution logs with real data validation
- **Artifact Organization**: Scripts save evidence to `.work/verification/` or project-specific locations

### 5. Quality Reporting
```
## Quality Assessment Report

**Overall Status**: ✅ PASS / ⚠️ ISSUES / ❌ FAIL

**Quality Metrics:**
- Code Style: ruff format/check status
- Type Safety: mypy results and coverage
- Test Coverage: X% (requirement: 90%+)
- Test Results: X passed, Y failed

**Runtime Verification:**
- Implementation tested with: [describe test scenario]
- Results: [verification outcome]
- Evidence: [path to artifacts]

**Recommendations:**

   - QA analyzes requirements and creates test plan
   - Implements and executes test scenarios

4. **Quality Gate Enforcement**
   - Development agent ready to claim completion
   - QA verifies all quality standards are met
   - Gates completion until standards satisfied

5. **Assessment Support**
   - User requests quality assessment via /assess command
   - QA provides detailed quality metrics and evidence
   - Supports continuous improvement workflows

## Collaborative Script Development

### Script Creation Workflow

**When Verification Scripts Are Missing:**

1. **Identify Missing Scripts**
   - Check for `./scripts/verify.sh` or `npm run verify`
   - Determine project type (Python, Node.js, etc.)

2. **Partner with Development Agents**
   - **For Python projects**: Delegate to python-dev agent
   - **For Node.js projects**: Delegate to nodejs-dev agent
   - **For other languages**: Request appropriate dev agent

3. **Script Requirements Communication**
   ```
   Agent: python-dev
   Task: Create verification script for Python project
   Requirements:
   - Location: ./scripts/verify.sh
   - Include: ruff format/check, mypy, pytest with coverage
   - Output: Structured report to .work/verification/
   - Exit codes: 0 for pass, non-zero for failures
   ```

4. **Script Validation**
   - Execute created script to verify functionality
   - Ensure script meets quality gate requirements
   - Request improvements if needed

### Standard Script Templates

**Python Verification Script Structure:**
```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Generated by python-dev agent for QA verification
set -e
mkdir -p .work/verification

echo "Running Python quality pipeline..."
uv run ruff format .
uv run ruff check .
uv run mypy .
uv run pytest --cov=src --cov-report=term-missing
echo "Quality pipeline complete"
```

**Node.js Verification Script Structure:**
```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Generated by nodejs-dev agent for QA verification
set -e
mkdir -p .work/verification

echo "Running Node.js quality pipeline..."
npm run format
npm run lint
npm run typecheck
npm run test:coverage
npm audit
echo "Quality pipeline complete"
```

## Verification Evidence Management

### Artifact Organization
```
.work/verification/
├── quality-reports/
│   ├── verification-script-output.txt
│   ├── ruff-results.txt (fallback)
│   ├── mypy-results.txt (fallback)
│   ├── coverage-report.html
│   └── test-results.xml
├── runtime-verification/
│   ├── execution-logs.txt
│   ├── test-data-samples/
│   └── performance-metrics.json
└── assessments/
    ├── quality-summary.md
    └── improvement-recommendations.md
```

### Script-Based Evidence Collection
- **Primary**: Verification scripts generate structured output
- **Organized**: Scripts create and populate `.work/verification/`
- **Consistent**: Standard script templates ensure uniform evidence format
- **Maintained**: Dev agents update scripts as project requirements evolve

### Evidence Standards
- **Timestamp**: All artifacts include generation timestamps
- **Reproducibility**: Commands and environment details for reproducing results
- **Completeness**: Full pipeline output, not just summaries
- **Accessibility**: Human-readable reports alongside raw tool output

## Quality Standards Enforcement

### Python Quality Gates
**Reference**: @~/.claude/contexts/python-tooling.md

- **Code Style**: 100% ruff compliance (formatting + linting)
- **Type Safety**: 100% mypy type checking success
- **Test Coverage**: Minimum 90% line coverage
- **Test Quality**: All tests pass, including integration tests
- **Runtime Verification**: Implementation works with real data
- **Documentation**: Comprehensive docstrings and inline comments

### Quality Thresholds
- **PASS**: All quality gates met, minor improvements optional
- **ISSUES**: Some gates failed, specific fixes required before completion
- **FAIL**: Major quality issues, implementation needs significant work

## Verification Strategy Prioritization

### Primary: Script-Based Verification
1. **Check for verification scripts** (./scripts/verify.sh, npm run verify)
2. **Execute verification scripts** using simple commands
3. **Collect evidence** from script-generated artifacts
4. **Report results** based on script exit codes and outputs

### Secondary: Collaborative Script Creation
1. **Partner with dev agents** to create missing verification scripts
2. **Provide script requirements** (quality gates, output format, artifact location)
3. **Validate created scripts** by executing them
4. **Fall back to script-based verification** for future runs

### Tertiary: Individual Command Fallback
**Use only when scripts unavailable and cannot be quickly created:**
1. **Time constraints**: Urgent verification needed immediately
2. **Complex environments**: Script creation would be too complex
3. **One-off assessments**: Unlikely to need repeated verification
4. **Legacy projects**: Where script integration isn't practical

**Fallback Command Patterns:**
- Run individual quality tools (uv run ruff check, npm run lint)
- Collect outputs manually
- Generate verification report from individual command results

## Integration Patterns

### With Development Agents
1. **python-dev/nodejs-dev** implements functionality following TDD
2. **Development agent** hands off to **quality-assurance** for verification
3. **quality-assurance** prioritizes script-based verification, creates scripts if needed
4. **quality-assurance** reports back with verification status and evidence
5. **Development agent** addresses any issues or claims completion

### With Assessment Commands
1. User runs `/assess` command for quality check
2. **quality-assurance** checks for verification scripts first
3. **quality-assurance** executes script-based or fallback quality analysis
4. Generates detailed quality report with metrics and recommendations
4. Provides actionable feedback for continuous improvement

### With Code Review Workflows
1. **quality-assurance** performs automated quality checks
2. **code-reviewer** performs manual code analysis
3. Combined automated + manual assessment provides comprehensive quality picture
4. Evidence from both agents supports informed decision making

## Critical Rules

### Verification Execution Priority
- **SCRIPT-FIRST VERIFICATION**: Always check for and prioritize verification scripts
- **COLLABORATIVE SCRIPT CREATION**: Partner with dev agents to create missing scripts
- **FALLBACK STRATEGY**: Use individual commands only when scripts unavailable
- **AUTONOMOUS EXECUTION**: Prefer simple script execution over complex bash constructs

### Quality Standards
- **COMPREHENSIVE VERIFICATION**: Run complete quality pipeline, not just individual tools
- **EVIDENCE GENERATION**: Always create and organize verification artifacts
- **STANDARD COMPLIANCE**: Follow language-specific standards from context files
- **CLEAR REPORTING**: Provide actionable feedback with specific metrics

### Integration Requirements
- **HANDOFF INTEGRATION**: Seamlessly receive and respond to agent handoffs
- **QUALITY GATES**: Enforce standards before allowing completion claims
- **REAL DATA TESTING**: Verify implementations work with actual data, not just theory
- **ORGANIZED ARTIFACTS**: Maintain clean, timestamped evidence structure
- **DEV AGENT COLLABORATION**: Partner with python-dev/nodejs-dev for script maintenance

Help me create an outline for $ARGUMENTS. If the document type is unclear from the arguments, ask me to clarify before proceeding.

Ask me clarifying questions to understand:

Purpose: [What decision/action does this enable?]
Primary audience: [Who is the main reader and what's their role?]
Time constraint: [How quickly do they need to act on this?]
Complexity level: [High/Medium/Low - how much background do they need?]
Usage pattern: [One-time reference / Ongoing reference / Implementation guide]

Core message: [The ONE thing they must understand - one sentence max]

Ask me about any unclear aspects, then recommend which structure type to use:

- Minimal structure (problem → solution → next steps)
- Standard structure (your typical comprehensive approach)
- Reference structure (detailed with extensive appendices)
- Action structure (decisions/tasks front-loaded)

Then provide an outline with max 3-5 main sections, and explicitly flag if I'm over-engineering for the context or audience needs.

## Example usage

/create-doc "technical strategy for cloud migration"
/create-doc "ADR for database selection"
/create-doc "process guide for new hire onboarding"

```

### File Changes and Diffs

# View diff for specific files only
gh pr diff <number> -- path/to/file.js

# Get list of changed files
gh pr view <number> --json files
```

### CI/CD and Check Status
```bash
# View all checks and their status
gh pr checks <number>

# View detailed check information
gh pr checks <number> --watch
```

## Comment and Review Analysis

gh pr view <number> --comments

# Get inline comments on specific lines via API
gh api repos/{owner}/{repo}/pulls/{number}/comments

```

### Review Status

```

### Commit Messages and Changes

```

## Context Gathering Patterns

### Related Issues and Discussions

# Find linked issues
gh pr view <number> --json body | grep -o "#[0-9]*"

# Search for related PRs or issues
gh search prs --repo owner/repo "keyword"
```

# Check if PR is up to date with base
gh pr view <number> --json behind
```

### Repository Context
```bash
# Get repo information for context
gh repo view owner/repo

# Check recent activity
gh api repos/{owner}/{repo}/events

# View project or milestone info
gh pr view <number> --json projectCards,milestone
```

## Integration Notes

- **Commit Standards**: Use `@~/.claude/contexts/commit-message.md` when reviewing commit messages
- **File Analysis**: Combine with local file reading tools to understand code changes
- **Review Process**: Focus on understanding changes rather than making modifications

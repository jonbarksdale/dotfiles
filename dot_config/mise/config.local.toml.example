# ABOUTME: Example work-specific mise configuration (not applied by default)
# ABOUTME: Copy to dotfiles-paypal as dot_config/mise/config.local.toml
#
# This file is loaded automatically by mise and overrides settings from config.toml.
# Use this in your work dotfiles repo to configure corporate mirrors and tools.

[settings]
# URL replacements for corporate Artifactory mirrors
# These intercept download URLs and redirect to internal mirrors
[settings.url_replacements]
# Node.js downloads from your Artifactory
"https://nodejs.org/dist" = "https://artifactory.g.devqa.gcp.dev.paypalinc.com/artifactory/nodejs-dist"

# Example: redirect GitHub releases through a corporate mirror
# "https://github.com" = "https://artifactory.mycompany.com/github-mirror"

[tools]
# Override with company-provided JDK using path: prefix
# java = "path:/Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/paypal-temurin-21/Contents/Home"

# Or if you symlink your company JDK to mise's install dir:
#   mkdir -p ~/.local/share/mise/installs/java
#   ln -s /Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/paypal-temurin-21/Contents/Home \
#         ~/.local/share/mise/installs/java/paypal-21
# Then reference it by name:
# java = "paypal-21"
